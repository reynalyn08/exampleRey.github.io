                            <p>Cybersecurity is the defense against cyberthreats for systems connected to the internet, 
                                including their hardware, software, and data. Individuals and businesses both utilize this
                                 technique to prevent illegal access to data centers and other digital systems. 
                                 Security measures are essential in preventing attacks that try to take down or impair
                                  a system or device's functionality.</p>
